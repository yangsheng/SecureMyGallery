# Foxbrowser

The purpose of the project is to provide a full Firefox Sync powered replacement for Mobile Safari on iOS devices.
Two way sync is supported, what is still lacking is support for stored passwords and form autocompletion.

- Full Firefox Sync (Open tabs, Bookmarks & History)
- Secure end to end encrypted transport of your Sync data
- Supports Do Not Track
- Start screen with the most frequent visited history entry's
- See open tabs from your other Firefox Sync enabled devices
- Real-time search in your browsing history, bookmarks and tabs
- Search engine integration in the Address bar
- Share URL's via Facebook, Twitter, Mail, Google+
- Search in the website
